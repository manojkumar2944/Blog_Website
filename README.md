# Blog Website using HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB

This project is a full-stack blog website that allows users to read and write posts. The front-end is built using HTML and CSS for a clean and responsive interface. On the back-end, Node.js and Express handle server-side operations, while MongoDB is used for data storage. Users can create, view, and manage blog posts efficiently with a structured, user-friendly system. The website showcases seamless integration of front-end design and back-end functionality for content creation and management.
